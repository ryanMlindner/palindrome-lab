There is a reference to a palindrome problem on the syllabus, 
but I cannot find it so I made my own.
there is a simple input frontend,
should run without any fancy stuff, just clone and go :)

Or if you don't want to change or run anything yourself, it is live through github pages at https://ryanmlindner.github.io/palindrome-lab/
